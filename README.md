# RL Soccer

This is a reinforcement learning project I did for fun. It's a 2 vs 2 top-down physics-based soccer game. You control one player (bottom left by default). Your enemies and your teammate are controlled by reinforcement learning agents, that were previously trained using self-play.

The AIs play differently to humans so you need to learn how to work together with your AI teammate.

You can also play with multiple players on one keyboard by adjusting the controls below.

The models where trained in this repository: https://github.com/Jim-Maar/marl-2vs2-soccer

The game is playable at https://jim-maar.github.io/marl-2vs2-soccer-webapp/
